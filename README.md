# Calculator 
This on screen calculator provides answers for mathematical equaitons.

All inputs are determined by the user and outcomes are calculated and output using JavaScript.

## Technologies used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Challenges
This project is not an example of proper github usage. A lot of testing went in to building this calculator and unfortunately most of it was done on my system, without making many commits.
Some of the challenges I faced were:
* Keyboard support
* User decimal input
* Creating math functions that will work seemlessly together

In the future, I hope to revist this project and cleanup my current JavaScript code.
